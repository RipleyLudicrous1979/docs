# Best Practices

## Two-step or Two-factor auth

### Separate Apple ID for CI

The easiest way to get _fastlane_ running on a CI system is to create a separate Apple ID that doesn't have 2-factor auth enabled, with a long, randomly generated password. Additionally make sure the newly created Apple account has limited access to only the apps and resources it needs.

There are multiple reasons on why this approach is much easier:

- An Apple ID session is only valid for a certain region, meaning if your CI system is in a different region than your local machine, you'll run into issues
- An Apple ID session is only valid for up to a month, meaning you'll have to generate a new session every month. Usually you'd only know about it when your build starts failing

There is nothing _fastlane_ can do better in that regard, as these are technical limitations on how App Store Connect sessions are handled.

Creating a separate Apple ID allows you to limit the permission scope, have a randomly generated password, and will make it much easier for you to set up CI using _fastlane_.

### Security code and session

When your Apple account has 2-factor or 2-step auth enabled, you'll be asked to verify your identity by entering a security code. If you already have a trusted device configured for your account, then the code will appear on the device. If you don't have any devices configured, but have trusted a phone number, then the code will be sent to your phone. The resulting session will be stored in `~/.fastlane/spaceship/[email]/cookie`. Again, the session should be valid for about one month, however there is no way to test this without actually waiting for over a month.

### Use of application specific passwords and `spaceauth`

Before going through this guide, make sure to read the section above.

If you want to upload builds to TestFlight / App Store Connect from your CI machine, you need to generate an application specific password:

1. Visit [appleid.apple.com/account/manage](https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage)
1. Generate a new application specific password
1. Provide the application specific password using the environment variable `FASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`

Because your CI machine will not be able to prompt you for your two-step or two-factor auth information, you also need to generate a login session for your CI machine in advance. You can get this by running:

```
fastlane spaceauth -u user@email.com
```

This will generate a token you can set using the `FASTLANE_SESSION` environment variable on your CI system.

### Bypass trusted device and use SMS for verification

If you have a trusted device configured, Apple will not send a SMS code to your phone for your Apple account when you try to generate a web session with _fastlane_. Instead, a code will be displayed on one of your account's trusted devices. This can be problematic if you are trying to authenticate but don't have access to a trusted device. Take the following steps to circumvent the device and use SMS instead:

- Attempt to generate a web session with `fastlane spaceauth -u [email]` and wait for security code prompt to appear
- Open a browser to [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com) or an address that requires you to login with your Apple ID, and logout of any previous session
- Login with your Apple ID and request a code be sent to the desired phone when prompted for a security code
- Use the code sent to phone with _fastlane_ instead of with the browser

## Environment variables to set

Most setups will need the following environment variables

- `FASTLANE_USER`: Your App Store Connect / Dev Portal user, if your _fastlane_ setup accesses iTC or the DevPortal (e.g. submit a TestFlight build, create a profile, ...)
- `FASTLANE_PASSWORD`: Your App Store Connect / Dev Portal password, usually only needed if you also set the `FASTLANE_USER` variable
- `MATCH_PASSWORD`: You need to provide the password of your _match_ encryption if you use _match_
- `FASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`: You need to provide an [application specific password](#two-step-or-two-factor-auth) if you have 2-factor enabled and use _pilot_ or _deliver_ to upload a binary to App Store Connect
- `LANG` and `LC_ALL`: These set up the locale your shell and all the commands you execute run at. _fastlane_ needs these to be set to an UTF-8 locale to work correctly, for example `en_US.UTF-8`. Many CI systems come with a locale that is unset or set to ASCII by default, so make sure to double-check whether yours is set correctly.

## Deploy Strategy

You should **not** deploy a new App Store update after every commit, since you still have to wait 1-2 days for the review. Instead it is recommended that you use Git Tags, or custom triggers to deploy a new update.

You can set up your own ```Release``` job, which is only triggered manually.

## Integrations

Multiple CI products and services offer integrations with fastlane:

- [Jenkins](/best-practices/continuous-integration/jenkins/)
- [CircleCI](/best-practices/continuous-integration/circle-ci/)
- [Travis](/best-practices/continuous-integration/travis/)
- [Bamboo](/best-practices/continuous-integration/bamboo/)
- [GitLab CI](/best-practices/continuous-integration/gitlab/)
- [Azure DevOps](/best-practices/continuous-integration/azure-devops/) (formerly known as: Visual Studio Team Services)
- [NeverCode](/best-practices/continuous-integration/nevercode/)
